OPSEU REGION,Example Cities / Areas,Description/Blurb ,Continued from Description Blurb but hyperlinked 
Region 1,"Windsor, London, Sarnia, Chatham, Leamington, St. Thomas","Southwestern Ontario members have watched public institutions absorb cut after cut and keep absorbing — hospitals restructuring staff, jails running over capacity, services quietly contracted out. The work doesn't stop; the support does.","What in your workplace has been ""restructured"" in the last few years, and did the union have a plan before it happened or a response after?"
Region 2,"Guelph, Hamilton, Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, Owen Sound, Brantford","Developmental services workers supporting clients on waitlists that stretch years, college staff who struck for five weeks and returned to conditions that predate most of their careers, community workers among the lowest-paid in the entire public sector — the range of what members in this region are carrying is wide and the chronic underfunding runs across almost all of it. Different workplaces, different employers, same pattern.",What would it take for that patterns within and across regions to be treated as one connected problem instead of a series of separate siloed ones?
Region 3,"Peterborough, Orillia, Midland, Huntsville, Port Hope, Lindsay","Central Ontario and the Kawarthas stretch from Algonquin Park down to Lake Ontario — a region where hospital professionals, developmental services workers, and child welfare staff carry frontline caseloads that don't make provincial headlines. The pressure lands quietly here.","When your workplace is at a breaking point, does the union feel like it already knows — or like it needs to be told?"
Region 4,"Ottawa, Kingston, Belleville, Brockville, Cornwall, Pembroke","Eastern Ontario members work across corrections, mental health, and community services — sectors where the stakes of underfunding aren't abstract, they're the person in front of you. Members here have gone to the table, filed grievances, gone on strike, and gone back to do it again.",What would it look like for leadership to match the intensity that members in this region already bring?
Region 5,"Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Markham, Vaughan, North York","Public sector workers in the GTA are holding up some of the province's most critical services while a full-time union job stops covering rent. The fights here have been loud and visible — LCBO, college campuses, corrections — and the cost of living has kept climbing through all of them. That's not bad luck. It's a coordination gap across sectors that share a region but not a strategy.",What would it take for the pressure members feel every month to become the thing the union is actually organized around?
Region 6,"Sudbury, North Bay, Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie, Cochrane, Hearst","From Sudbury to Timmins, the crises are not hypothetical — mental health workers locked out during an addiction emergency, corrections officers experiencing violence in chronically understaffed facilities, child protection workers holding a system together on goodwill and overtime. This corridor has some of the hardest working conditions in the province and some of the least acknowledgment for it.",What would change in your workplace if the union treated burnout in this region as a structural problem it owns — not a workforce issue it monitors?

Region 7,"Thunder Bay, Kenora, Dryden, Fort Frances, Red Lake, Sioux Lookout","Northwestern Ontario members know what it feels like when leadership is literally and politically far away — where wild land firefighters fought for years for basic reclassification, where corrections workers manage facilities built for a different era, where showing up to a conversation like this means something different when the nearest OPSEU office is hours away. Distance didn't stop these members.","When you look at your own workplace, where does the gap between OPSEU's priorities and your reality show up most?"
